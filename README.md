# tirebot
A Facebook Messenger bot that lets the user calculate the diameter variance between tires

Right now, it holds your original tire in memory.

You could send a tire code like `175/55R15`, and then `195/65R15` and you will get the diameter variance of that compared tire. Keep sending new tire codes to compare them to your original. Send `clear`to start over.
